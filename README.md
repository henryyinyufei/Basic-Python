# CMPT 120 Introduction To Computing Science And Programming

## Calender description: 

An elementary introduction to computing science and computer programming, suitable for students with little or no programming background. Students will learn fundamental concepts and terminology of computing science, acquire elementary skills for programming in a high-level language and be exposed to diverse fields within, and applications of computing science. Topics will include: pseudocode, data types and control structures, fundamental algorithms, computability and complexity, computer architecture, and history of computing science. Treatment is informal and programming is presented as a problem-solving tool.

## Topics

\begin{itemize}
  \item Algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode
  \item The second item of the list.
  \item An item with an \textsc{equation}:
    \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}\]
\end{itemize}

*Algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode

*Procedural programming in Python

*Data types and control structures

*Fundamental algorithms, including searching, sorting, basics of recursion
