Numbers represent:
type: 0 - 'TV series', 1- 'movie'
genres are coded with numbers 0,1,2 â€¦ based on  the  IN-genres.txt file data.
An X represents an unknown genre. A movie will have at least 1 genre (not X)
genres not necessarily are in order within one movie
rating: 0- 'G' , 1- 'PG', 2- 'PG 13', 3- 'NC17', 4- 'R'
origin: 0- 'Canadian', 1- 'Foreign'


Assumption: data is all correct
There are no repeated movies
